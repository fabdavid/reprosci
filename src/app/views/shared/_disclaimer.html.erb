<p>The aim of the ReproSci project is to assess the reproducibility of claims made in articles published in the field of Drosophila immunity. These assessments are not judgements of the `scientific value' of the research. Non-reproducible observations or interpretations may have positive impacts by developing new techniques and raising interesting concepts. Similarly, reproducible articles may only confirmatory findings or established techniques without significantly advancing the field. Furthermore, the ReproSci project leaders acknowledge that selection of claims within papers and assessments of those claims cannot be fully objective or comprehensive. By opening the database to experts, we hope that assessments gain a greater degree of objectivity and consensus, and generate ongoing discussion beyond simply deeming claims as `right' or `wrong'.</p> 

<p>The broader success of the ReproSci project therefore depends on experts being respectful in their words and interactions in discussing the data presented here. Thus, we ask you to accept and be mindful of the following disclaimer before registering with the database:
</p>
<p><b>In signing up to participate in the ReproSci database, I agree to be respectful to other users and researchers in comments, and to discuss data without making personal judgements of groups or individuals either on the ReproSci database or other platforms such as social media. I acknowledge that the purpose of this project and my participation is to derive new value from existing data.</b>
